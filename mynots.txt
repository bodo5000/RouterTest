thats was in index.php


// connect to our MYSQl dataBase
$config = require_once 'config.php';
$db = new DataBase($config['database']);

$id = ($_GET['id']);
// $query = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = {$id} " => this is bad way cause sql injection in url;

$query = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ? "; //same $query = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = :id "; 

// here we are binding data with [$id])->fetch()
$posts = $db->query($query, [$id])->fetch();

dd($posts);

// foreach ($posts as $post) {
//     echo '<li>' . $post['title'] . '</li>';
// }


very important:
    public folder -> fore document root ,css files and js files
    php -S localhost:8000 -t public/ ->make the server start from public/
    in php we can only read post or get request not delete or update or patch 
        so we will create new router class  to know how to send this as a methods

    now we will create our service Container: here he will make us avoid repeating the creation of db class and his own config    
    ClassName::class ->will give me string of this class example DataBase::class -> 'DataBase';



    new sessions:
        1-session data is temporary so its by default gone when we close the browser
        2- php --info will give us info about our server
        3- search in terminal for session.save_path => that's a path of my session
        4- most cases we don't need to create view for post controllers
        5- we will search for session hijacking
